# 🔋 Energy Consumption Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts **energy consumption** using **Machine Learning** techniques.  
It covers the full workflow — from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to training and evaluating regression models.  
The final model can forecast energy usage for better planning and resource optimization.
